Visualisation is a feature that will automatically generate a bar or scatter plot based on your dataset. You can affect this by changing the value of the **Choose plot type** dropdown. The tool dynamically reacts based on the series you select, as well as the method of aggregation.

Current aggregation options are Sum, Count, Min, Max, and Mean, with more to come in the future. You can pick your method from the **Select aggregation** dropdown in the sidebar.

You can also select the order of the x-axis to be ascending or descending by total or alphabetically from the **Choose x-axis order** dropdown in the sidebar.

You can also select the number of data points to display in the chart by entering an integer value into the **Choose number of data points to display** box.

When you have your visualisation in the format you want, you can download the image by clicking on the camera icon on the menu in the top-right corner of the plot.
