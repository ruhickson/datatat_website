About the Project

NanoData is an app that takes the pain out of analysis. It makes visualizations, insights, and model development instantaneous, so you can spend more time focusing on the what, than the how.

This project is intended for free use to all for datasets under 5MB in size. This is purely for cost mitigation at the moment. If you have a use case that requires a dataset > 5MB, please get in touch via the Contact page.

An enterprise solution to connect to databases and run NanoData as an integrated is in development and will be released later this year.

NanoData is the brainchild of [Ru Hickson](https://linkedin.com/in/ruhickson).

NanoData will shortly have a dedicated website for documentation. Until then, please connect on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/nano_data), or directly via email: ruhksn[at]gmail.com
