      <description>About the Project
NanoData is an app that takes the pain out of analysis. It makes visualizations, insights, and model development instantaneous, so you can spend more time focusing on the what, than the how.
This project is intended for free use to all for datasets under 5MB in size. This is purely for cost mitigation at the moment. If you have a use case that requires a dataset &amp;gt; 5MB, please get in touch via the Contact page.</description>

      <description>Visualisation is a feature that will automatically generate a bar or scatter plot based on your dataset. You can affect this by changing the value of the Choose plot type dropdown. The tool dynamically reacts based on the series you select, as well as the method of aggregation.
Current aggregation options are Sum, Count, Min, Max, and Mean, with more to come in the future. You can pick your method from the Select aggregation dropdown in the sidebar.</description>
