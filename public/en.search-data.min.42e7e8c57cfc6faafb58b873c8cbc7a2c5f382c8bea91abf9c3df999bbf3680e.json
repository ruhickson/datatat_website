Once you\u0026rsquo;ve uploaded your data, it\u0026rsquo;s straightforward to search through the table either using column-wise filters or the overall search bar.\nOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve uploaded your files, the Table Explorer will automatically populate with a paginated version of your data. There are some functions the Table Explorer enacts on your data before it is displayed that may require some user input.\nFirst is confirming whether or not the data has a header. This is the first option at the top of the hk48 sidebar. Tick if the data has a header, Untick it if not.\nSecond is what type of separator is used to delimit your data. Currently, the options are Comma, Semicolon, and Tab, though a \u0026lsquo;custom\u0026rsquo; option is being developed for the near future.\nThird is whether or not the character fields in your data have double, single, or no quotation marks. It will be immediately evident if the wrong Quote option is in place. The Quote buttons in the sidebar can be used to select the appropriate option.\nFourth: in the case of datasets with large volumes of content in certain fields, the option to restrict the number of rows displayed by default in the Table Explorer to six. This is recommended to improve app performance if your data file contains large json or key-value fields.\nLastly, hk48 will enforce an ISO 8601 date format on all date fields in your data. This is done by using a guessing algorithm from the lubridate package in R, which will attempt to interpret the date format of your file\u0026rsquo;s date fields and convert them to YYYY-MM-DD. This is done in order to simplify working with dates. An option to convert to custom date formats is being developed.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/docs/data-analysis-domo/","title":"A Web-Based Alternative to Analytics in Domo","section":"Docs","content":"Domo is an amazing BI Tool, but it can be expensive, and has a non-trivial barrier to entry for usage, and you probably don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of time to commit to learning it.

You can affect this by changing the value of the Choose plot type dropdown. The tool dynamically reacts based on the series you select, as well as the method of aggregation.\nCurrent aggregation options are Sum, Count, Min, Max, and Mean, with more to come in the future. You can pick your method from the Select aggregation dropdown in the sidebar.\nYou can also select the order of the x-axis to be ascending or descending by total or alphabetically from the Choose x-axis order dropdown in the sidebar.\nYou can also select the number of data points to display in the chart by entering an integer value into the Choose number of data points to display box.\nWhen you have your visualisation in the format you want, you can download the image by clicking on the camera icon on the menu in the top-right corner of the plot.\nIf you want to export the underlying aggregated data from the plot, you can do so by clicking on the Download button in the sidebar.\n"},{"id":35,"href":"/docs/data-analysis-from-scratch/","title":"Your Starting Line for Data Analysis","section":"Docs","content":"Data Analysis can be a daunting task to start.
